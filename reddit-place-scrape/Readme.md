# Reddit /r/place scrape

This is some code I used to periodically scrape /r/place then convert those scrapes to images that were stitched together into [a video on my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s69GbUvep_U). The images were stitched together to a video using FFMPEG.

/r/place is over, it was an April fools social experiment by Reddit. During the experiment you could place one pixel on a 1,000 by 1,000 grid every 5 mins. This lead to lots of pixel art being created and destroyed as can be seen in [my timelapse video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s69GbUvep_U).

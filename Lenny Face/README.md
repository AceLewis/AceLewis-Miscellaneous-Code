# Lenny Face - ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° )
Lenny face is a meme originally Lenny was just one face but now encompases many faces made with Unicode symbols some examples are given below;

* \\(૦ઁ ͜つ૦ઁ)/
* ⤜(□.□)⤏
* 乁( ͠°ツ °)ㄏ

This was an example site that just displays a random Lenny Face. I used this sitte in a [video showing how to generate a custom bitcoin address to use within ZeroNet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBkg837jpZ4). The site can be accessed in ZeroNet via http://127.0.0.1:43110/1LennyjL5VUTvwiLtBUjMrZ85gCbVe1dj1/ or via [AceZeroProxy](https://github.com/AceLewis/AceZeroProxy) https://zero.acelewis.com/#1LennyjL5VUTvwiLtBUjMrZ85gCbVe1dj1/.

This site is just a joke... it uses the [RESTful-Lenny](https://github.com/Casper-Oakley/RESTful-lenny) API (http://lenny.today). I fully understand that it would be pretty trivial to generate the Lenny faces purely in client side Javascript however it is much funnier to use the API. (In the future if/when the API goes down I will just use client side stuff)
